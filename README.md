# MSBL-Analyzer
Repository for creating an analyzer and parser for Mario Strikers Battle League (MSBL) gameplay videos.

## Design Docs
- Video analysis library design: docs/video-analysis-design.md

## GUI Viewer (prototype)
An interactive desktop viewer to play a video and overlay analysis results.

Run locally on Windows (PowerShell):

1) Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)
2) Install dependencies
3) Launch the app

The viewer will attempt to load `tracks.json` and `events.json` from the same folder as the opened video.
